Iâ€™m interested in Rust, C++ and Web development and use Linux for everything I do. On many projects I work together with @DevelLight, for example the most recent one is the rewrite on PinguControl in Rust with a nicer UI. I currently work on an application for archiving and preserving PC games, also written in Rust. I also plan on contributing to nixpkgs from time to time, since I use NixOS on most of my machines, since it makes it much easier to have the same experience across all of them because of it's declarative and reproducible nature.

ðŸ“« You can reach me through Discord (theredstonedev_de) or Matrix (@theredstonedev_de:matrix.devellight.space) if there are any urgent or legal problems. Otherwise **I'd prefer you just creating an issue** in the related project.
